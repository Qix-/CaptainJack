JACK was inspired by and partially designed during discussions on the
Linux Audio Developers mailing list. Particularly significant
contributions to those discussions came from (in alphabetical order):

    Paul Davis
    David Olofson
    Benno Sennoner
    Kai Vehmanen
    
Many other members of LAD contributed ideas to JACK, particularly
Richard Guenther.
