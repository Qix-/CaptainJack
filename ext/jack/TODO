*** TODO - A one file mini-bugzilla for JACK developers             ***
=======================================================================

Version: $Id$

NOTE: web-based bug tracker for JACK was put online in Oct 2003. It is 
      now the preferred way to report and track bugs and feature 
      requests. This TODO file is now used only for tracking release 
      issues (mapping features and other todo-items to release 
      roadmap, etc).

The new bug tracker can be found at:

    http://jackit.sourceforge.net/mantis/

You can update this list directly via CVS or alternatively
send a change request to jackit-devel mailing list.

TODO for merging Mac OS X support

- clean up other header files
  -- <sysdeps/poll.h>, fakepoll.h, etc.
  -- <sysdeps/ipc.h>, <sys/ipc.h> in shm.c

TODO before-1.0

- add explanation of protocol versioning to README.developers (kaiv)

TODO post-1.0

- jack session handling (taybin)
- first client run without jackd becomes jackd (joq)
- TBD

TODO general - no agreed timeline

- better scheme for handling machine and system dependencies (joq)
- proper handling of client return values in libjack
- pool based malloc for rt client-local mem allocation (paul, moved back here)

TO BE DECIDED - no agreed timeline

- dropping the use of CAP_RESOURCE (nando)
- support for on-the-fly sampling rate change
- whether to default to triangular dithering for 16bit output. (swh)

TO THINK ABOUT - no agreed timeline

- ensure that UST/MSC pairs work for transport API
- whether we want to support varispeed (resampling and/or changing
  the actual rate)
- per-block timestamping against system clock (UST stamps at driver level)
- dynamically increase the total number of ports in the system

CLOSED (date,who,comment)
